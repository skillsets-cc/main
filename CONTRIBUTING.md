# Contributing to Skillsets.cc

Skillsets.cc is the trust layer missing in the native Claude Code plugin ecosystem. It is a reputation foundry for plugin creators, a discovery engine for users, and a quality standard for the ecosystem. We accept complete workflows that have shipped real software, with clear documentation and evidence of production use.

### Prerequisites

- The skillsets.cc plugin installed 
```
claude plugin marketplace add skillsets-cc/main
/plugin install skillset@skillsets-cc
```
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- NPM installed
- An existing Claude Code workflow with `.claude/` primitives
- Evidence of production use
- A claimed slot reservation at [skillsets.cc](https://skillsets.cc)

## Quick Start

The easiest way to submit is with the `/skillset:contribute` wizard. It walks you through the full flow — scaffolding, content prep, audits, and submission — step by step.

```
# In Claude Code, with the skillsets.cc plugin installed:
/skillset:contribute
```

The wizard orchestrates the same commands you'd run manually (see [Manual Flow](#manual-flow) below), but guides you through each step, reviews your content, helps resolve audit warnings, and fills in manifest fields collaboratively.

## Manual Flow

If you prefer to run each step yourself, or want to understand what `/skillset:contribute` does under the hood:

```bash
# 1. Initialize (scaffolds structure + installs audit skill)
npx skillsets init

# 2. Prepare content in /content, edit PROOF.md with production evidence

# 3. Structural validation
npx skillsets audit

# 4. Qualitative review (in Claude Code)
/audit-skill [AUDIT_REPORT.md] [path/to/reference-repo]

# 5. Submit PR to registry (requires gh CLI)
npx skillsets submit
```

## Generated Structure

`npx skillsets init` auto-detects existing skillset files (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`) and support stack directories (any top-level directory containing a dependency manifest or config file like `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, etc.) in your project root and offers to copy them into `content/`. When copying directories, `node_modules/`, `.env`, and lock files are automatically excluded.

```

## Audit Requirements

`npx skillsets audit` runs structural validation. Your submission must pass all checks before the qualitative review.

**Required structure** (all must be present):
- `skillset.yaml` — valid manifest (see reference below)
- `content/README.md` — user-facing documentation
- `content/QUICKSTART.md` — post-install customization guide (walked through by `/skillset:install`)
- `content/CLAUDE.md` — project instructions entry point
- `content/.claude/` — Claude Code primitives (skills, agents, hooks, settings)

**Gating checks**:
| Check | Rule |
|-------|------|
| Manifest | Valid schema, semver version, author handle, tags, production links |
| Required files | `skillset.yaml`, `content/`, `content/README.md` |
| Content structure | Both `content/.claude/` and `content/CLAUDE.md` present |
| README links | Links to `content/.claude/` must use full GitHub URLs |
| Version | Updates must have version > existing registry version |
| MCP consistency | Content↔manifest MCP declarations must match (gating in CI `--check` mode only) |

**Non-gating warnings** (surfaced for review, don't block submission):
| Warning | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Secrets | Potential credentials detected (API keys, tokens, private keys, connection strings, generic assignments) |
| File size | Files over 1MB |
| Binary files | Binary files in content/ |

When warnings are found, the audit reports **"READY FOR SUBMISSION — warnings require review"**. The `/skillset:contribute` wizard helps triage each warning — confirming false positives or resolving real issues before submission.

The `/audit-skill` handles qualitative review: primitive quality, MCP reputation research, workflow verification against a reference repo, and safety scanning.

# Optional: MCP servers (populated by /audit-skill if your skillset uses them)

## README Link Format

Links in your README.md that point to files within your skillset (e.g., skills, agents, resources) must use full GitHub URLs so they work on skillsets.cc:

```markdown
<!-- ✓ Correct -->
[SKILL.md](https://github.com/skillsets-cc/main/blob/main/skillsets/%40username/skillset-name/content/.claude/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md)

<!-- ✗ Incorrect - will 404 on skillsets.cc -->
[SKILL.md](content/.claude/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md)
```

Note: Use `%40` for the `@` symbol in the username.

The tier 1 audit (`npx skillsets audit`) will flag relative links that should use this format.

## Production Proof

Your `PROOF.md` must demonstrate real-world usage:

- Link to live deployed application or public repository
- Metrics (test coverage, deployments, code shipped)
- Links to videos, writeups, or case studies (external links, not embedded)

See [@supercollectible/Valence/PROOF.md](./skillsets/@supercollectible/Valence/PROOF.md) for an example.

## Updating a Skillset

```bash
# Bump version in skillset.yaml, then:
npx skillsets audit              # Shows: Update: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
/audit-skill [AUDIT_REPORT.md] [path/to/reference-repo]
npx skillsets submit             # Creates update PR
```

## Deprecating a Skillset

Update `status` in `skillset.yaml`:
- `"deprecated"` - still discoverable, with warning
- `"archived"` - removed from discovery

## Review Process

1. **Automated CI**: Runs `npx skillsets audit --check` to re-validate the full structural audit (schema, files, content, secrets, MCP consistency) and verifies the PR author matches the skillset author
2. **Maintainer Review**: Production proof quality, documentation clarity, MCP server justification, overall value
