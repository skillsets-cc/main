# Contributing to Skillsets.cc

Thank you for your interest in sharing your production-verified Claude Code workflow! This guide will walk you through the submission process.

## Overview

Skillsets.cc is a curated registry of **production-verified** Claude Code workflows. We accept submissions that meet strict quality standards and can demonstrate real-world production usage.

### What We Accept
✅ Complete workflows that have shipped production software
✅ Well-documented skills, agents, and configurations
✅ Clear installation and usage instructions
✅ Evidence of production deployment
✅ Audited and validated structure

### What We Don't Accept
❌ Unproven or experimental workflows
❌ Single skills without complete context
❌ Workflows without production proof
❌ Incomplete or poorly documented submissions
❌ Copyrighted or proprietary content (without permission)

## Submission Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare Your Skillset Locally

Create a directory structure for your skillset:

```
your-skillset/
├── skillset.yaml              # Manifest (required)
├── README.md                  # Installation and usage guide (required)
├── AUDIT_REPORT.md           # Generated by audit skill (required)
├── PROOF.md                  # Production evidence (optional but recommended)
└── content/                  # Files to install (required)
    ├── .claude/              # Skills and agents (required)
    │   ├── skills/           # Your custom skills
    │   └── agents/           # Your custom agents
    └── CLAUDE.md             # Project-level instructions (required or use .claude/)
```

### Step 2: Create skillset.yaml

The manifest file describes your skillset and makes it discoverable.

**Template**:
```yaml
schema_version: "1.0"

# Identity
name: "Your_Skillset_Name"
version: "1.0.0"
description: "Brief description of your skillset (10-200 characters)"

author:
  handle: "@your-github-username"
  url: "https://github.com/your-github-username"

# Verification
verification:
  production_url: "https://your-production-deployment.com"
  production_proof: "./PROOF.md"  # Optional
  audit_report: "./AUDIT_REPORT.md"

# Discovery
tags:
  - "tag1"
  - "tag2"
  - "tag3"

compatibility:
  claude_code_version: ">=1.0.0"
  languages:
    - "python"
    - "typescript"

# Lifecycle
status: "active"

# Content
entry_point: "./content/CLAUDE.md"
```

**Field Requirements**:
- `name`: Alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only. No spaces.
- `version`: Semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0)
- `description`: 10-200 characters
- `author.handle`: Must match your GitHub username (e.g., @yourname)
- `tags`: 1-10 tags, lowercase, hyphens only
- `status`: One of: `active`, `deprecated`, `archived`

### Step 3: Write README.md

Your README should include:

1. **Overview**: What does this skillset provide?
2. **Installation**: How to install (CLI and manual methods)
3. **Usage**: How to use the skills and agents
4. **Examples**: Concrete usage examples
5. **Configuration**: Any customization options
6. **Requirements**: Prerequisites and compatibility
7. **License**: How others can use your skillset

**See**: [`skillsets/@supercollectible/The_Skillset/README.md`](./skillsets/@supercollectible/The_Skillset/README.md) for a complete example.

### Step 4: Download and Run the Audit Skill

Visit [skillsets.cc/contribute](https://skillsets.cc/contribute) to download the `/audit_skillset` skill.

**Installation**:
```bash
# Download the audit skill
curl -O https://skillsets.cc/tools/audit_skillset.tar.gz
tar -xzf audit_skillset.tar.gz

# Copy to your Claude Code skills directory
cp -r audit_skillset ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Run the audit**:
```bash
# Navigate to your skillset directory
cd path/to/your-skillset/

# Run the audit skill in Claude Code
/audit_skillset
```

The audit will:
- Validate `skillset.yaml` against JSON Schema
- Check required files exist
- Verify content structure
- Detect large files (>1MB)
- Scan for binary files
- Look for potential secrets
- Generate `AUDIT_REPORT.md`

**Fix any issues** reported by the audit before submitting.

### Step 5: Provide Production Proof

Create `PROOF.md` with evidence that your workflow has been used in production:

**Acceptable Evidence**:
- Link to live deployed application
- Link to public GitHub repository with activity
- Screenshots of deployed systems
- Testimonials from team members
- Metrics (test coverage, lines of code, deployments)
- Case studies or blog posts

**Example Structure**:
```markdown
# Production Proof: Your_Skillset

## Deployed Application
- URL: https://your-app.com
- Description: What it does
- Tech Stack: Technologies used

## GitHub Repository
- URL: https://github.com/you/repo
- Stars: X
- Production branches: main, production
- Evidence: Check commit history and PRs

## Metrics
- Lines of Code: X
- Test Coverage: X%
- Production Uptime: X%
- Active Users: X

## Screenshots
[Include screenshots of your deployed application]

## Testimonials
> "This workflow transformed how we build..."
> — Team Lead
```

**See**: [`skillsets/@supercollectible/The_Skillset/PROOF.md`](./skillsets/@supercollectible/The_Skillset/PROOF.md) for a complete example.

### Step 6: Submit Pull Request

1. **Fork** the [skillsets-cc/registry](https://github.com/skillsets-cc/registry) repository

2. **Clone** your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/registry.git
   cd registry
   ```

3. **Create** your skillset directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p skillsets/@your-username/Your_Skillset_Name
   ```

4. **Copy** your prepared files:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/your-skillset/* skillsets/@your-username/Your_Skillset_Name/
   ```

5. **Commit** your changes:
   ```bash
   git add skillsets/@your-username/
   git commit -m "Add @your-username/Your_Skillset_Name

   Brief description of the skillset and what it provides.

   Production URL: https://your-production-url.com"
   ```

6. **Push** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

7. **Open Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title: "Add @your-username/Your_Skillset_Name"
   - Description explaining what your skillset does
   - Link to production deployment
   - Summary of production proof
   - Any justifications for warnings (e.g., binary files)

### Step 7: Automated Validation

Our CI system will automatically:
- ✅ Validate `skillset.yaml` against JSON Schema
- ✅ Check required files exist
- ✅ Verify content structure
- ✅ Check file sizes (<1MB per file)
- ✅ Scan for secrets
- ✅ Verify author matches your GitHub username

**If CI fails**:
1. Review the error messages in the GitHub Actions log
2. Fix the issues locally
3. Push updates to your branch
4. CI will re-run automatically

### Step 8: Maintainer Review

A maintainer will manually review:
- Production proof quality and authenticity
- README clarity and completeness
- Skillset value and uniqueness
- Overall quality and documentation

**Review Timeline**: Most submissions reviewed within 3-5 business days.

**Possible Outcomes**:
1. **Approved**: PR merged, skillset goes live
2. **Changes Requested**: Fix issues and resubmit
3. **Rejected**: Does not meet quality standards

See [MAINTAINER_CHECKLIST.md](./MAINTAINER_CHECKLIST.md) for the complete review criteria.

### Step 9: Your Skillset Goes Live

Once merged:
1. 🎉 Your skillset appears on [skillsets.cc](https://skillsets.cc)
2. 📦 Available via `npx skillsets install @you/Your_Skillset`
3. 🔍 Discoverable in CLI search
4. ⭐ Users can star your skillset
