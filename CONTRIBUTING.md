# Contributing to Skillsets.cc

Skillsets.cc is a curated registry of **production-verified** Claude Code workflows. We accept complete workflows that have shipped real software, with clear documentation and evidence of production use.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize (scaffolds structure + installs audit skill)
npx skillsets init

# 2. Develop skillset in /content. Edit PROOF.md with production evidence

# 3. Tier 1: Structural validation
npx skillsets audit

# 4. Tier 2: Qualitative review (in Claude Code)
/audit-skill [AUDIT_REPORT.md] [path/to/reference-repo]

# 5. Submit PR to registry (requires gh CLI)
npx skillsets submit
```

# Optional: MCP servers (populated by /audit-skill if your skillset uses them)
# You don't need to write this manually — the qualitative review discovers
# MCP servers in your content, researches their reputation, and adds this section.

## README Link Format

Links in your README.md that point to files within your skillset (e.g., skills, agents, resources) must use full GitHub URLs so they work on skillsets.cc:

```markdown
<!-- ✓ Correct -->
[SKILL.md](https://github.com/skillsets-cc/main/blob/main/skillsets/%40username/skillset-name/content/.claude/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md)

<!-- ✗ Incorrect - will 404 on skillsets.cc -->
[SKILL.md](content/.claude/skills/your-skill/SKILL.md)
```

Note: Use `%40` for the `@` symbol in the username.

The tier 1 audit (`npx skillsets audit`) will flag relative links that should use this format.

## Production Proof

Your `PROOF.md` must demonstrate real-world usage:

- Link to live deployed application or public repository
- Metrics (test coverage, deployments, code shipped)
- Links to videos, writeups, or case studies (external links, not embedded)

See [@supercollectible/Valence/PROOF.md](./skillsets/@supercollectible/Valence/PROOF.md) for an example.

## Updating a Skillset

```bash
# Bump version in skillset.yaml, then:
npx skillsets audit              # Shows: Update: 1.0.0 → 1.1.0
/audit-skill [AUDIT_REPORT.md] [path/to/reference-repo]
npx skillsets submit             # Creates update PR
```

## Deprecating a Skillset

Update `status` in `skillset.yaml`:
- `"deprecated"` - still discoverable, with warning
- `"archived"` - removed from discovery

## Review Process

1. **Automated CI**: Runs `npx skillsets audit --check` to re-validate the full structural audit (schema, files, content, secrets, MCP consistency) and verifies the PR author matches the skillset author
2. **Maintainer Review**: Production proof quality, documentation clarity, MCP server justification, overall value
