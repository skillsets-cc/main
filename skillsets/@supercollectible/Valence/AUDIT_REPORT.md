## Qualitative Review

**Reviewed by:** Claude (Opus)
**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Reference repo:** /home/nook/Documents/code/skillsets.cc

### Primitives

| Type | Count | Assessment |
|------|-------|------------|
| Skills | 11 | Valid — 7/11 fully compliant; 4 minor (denoise, qb, qd, qf) lack trigger phrases in description |
| Agents | 9 | Valid — all have name, description, role, process, output format; proxy agents (ar-k, ar-d, pm-k) use intentional LiteLLM architecture |
| Hooks | 0 | N/A — no hooks configured; workflow enforcement is protocol-based |
| MCP | 1 Docker (2 inner) | Valid — litellm-proxy (docker, ghcr.io/berriai/litellm) with 2 inner servers: context7 (@upstash/context7-mcp) and filesystem (@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem, read-only) |
| CLAUDE.md | Y | Valid — 152 lines, well-structured (WHAT/WHY/HOW), uses file pointers and progressive disclosure via links |

#### Skills Detail

| Skill | Lines | Description Quality | Frontmatter | Status |
|-------|-------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| /ar | 163 | Trigger phrases present | Complete | PASS |
| /arm | 118 | Trigger phrases present | Complete | PASS |
| /audit-skill | 82 | Comprehensive | Complete | PASS |
| /build | 123 | Trigger phrases present | Complete | PASS |
| /denoise | 41 | Missing trigger phrase | Partial (no allowed-tools, argument-hint) | Minor |
| /design | 154 | Trigger phrases present | Complete | PASS |
| /plan | 180 | Trigger phrases present | Complete | PASS |
| /pmatch | 172 | Trigger phrases present | Complete | PASS |
| /qb | 39 | Missing trigger phrase | Partial (no allowed-tools, argument-hint) | Minor |
| /qd | 40 | Missing trigger phrase | Partial (no allowed-tools, argument-hint) | Minor |
| /qf | 39 | Missing trigger phrase | Partial (no allowed-tools, argument-hint) | Minor |

**Note on minor skills**: denoise, qb, qd, qf are thin orchestrator wrappers that delegate to agents with full protocols (code-simplifier, qa-b, qa-docs, qa-f respectively). The agent definitions contain the detailed process and output format. Missing `allowed-tools` and trigger phrases are minor — the skills function correctly as dispatchers.

#### Agents Detail

All 9 agents have: name (valid, lowercase/hyphens), description, role definition, process steps, and output format. Key observations:

- **Proxy agents (ar-k, ar-d, pm-k)**: Use `curl` to local LiteLLM at `localhost:4000` — intentional multi-model architecture for diverse review perspectives. Proper JSON escaping via `jq -n --arg`. Error handling documented ("if curl fails, report to lead, do NOT fabricate").
- **Direct agents (ar-o, pm-s)**: Self-contained with local tool access (Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, Context7).
- **Build agent**: Clear implementation protocol with phase tracking, task management, style guide references.
- **QA agents (qa-f, qa-b, qa-docs)**: Detailed audit workflows with iterative file processing, severity classification, structured reports.

#### MCP Servers Detail

**Source**: `content/docker/litellm/config.yaml` (Docker-hosted via LiteLLM)

**Docker entry**: `litellm-proxy` (type: docker, image: `ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-latest`) — actively maintained LLM proxy by BerriAI. Config mounted read-only, project directory mounted read-only. Port 4000 exposed (localhost only). API keys via env vars (`os.environ/`), not hardcoded. `.env.example` has empty placeholders.

**Inner servers** (running inside the Docker container):

| Server | Package | Weekly Downloads | Version | License | Risk |
|--------|---------|-----------------|---------|---------|------|
| context7 | @upstash/context7-mcp | 304k | 2.1.1 | MIT | Low — library doc retrieval only |
| filesystem | @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem | 171k | 2026.1.14 | MIT | Low — mounted read-only (:ro) |

**Version pinning warning**: Both inner MCP packages use `npx -y` without version pins. Recommend pinning to specific versions (e.g., `@upstash/context7-mcp@2.1.1`) for reproducible builds.

**Phase 2 note**: `skillset.yaml` `mcp_servers` was populated in a prior review pass and corrected from flat stdio entries to nested Docker structure after CI schema validation feedback.

**Runtime caveat**: MCP packages are fetched at runtime and may have changed since this audit. `researched_at: 2026-02-10` captures when the lookup was performed, not ongoing validity.

#### CLAUDE.md Detail

- **Line count**: 152 (under 300 limit, above 60 ideal)
- **Structure**: 4 sections — Identity & Constraints (WHAT), Navigation and Toolkit (HOW), Code Patterns (HOW), Testing and Logging (HOW)
- **File pointers**: Links to ARCHITECTURE_backend.md, ARCHITECTURE_frontend.md, frontend_styleguide.md, backend_styleguide.md, ARD.md
- **Progressive disclosure**: Documentation Map table with entry points; exploration pattern (README → ARC → per-file → source)
- **Code snippets**: Minimal (20 lines for test/logging examples) — acceptable for quick-reference patterns

### Safety Scan

**Status:** CLEAR

All 30 files scanned (11 skills, 9 agents, 6 resources, 1 CLAUDE.md, 3 Docker configs). No prompt injection, data exfiltration, behavior override, or malicious instructions detected.

Key safety observations:
- No hardcoded secrets — all API keys use `os.environ/` or `${VAR}` patterns
- No instructions to override Claude's safety guidelines
- No hidden output channels — all outputs are local files or team messages
- Proxy agents (ar-k, ar-d, pm-k) send design docs to localhost LiteLLM — intentional architecture, not exfiltration
- Docker volumes are read-only (`:ro`)
- JSON payloads use `jq -n --arg` for proper escaping (no injection vectors)

### Workflow Verification

**Claimed workflow:** Multi-phase SDLC — /arm (brief) → /design (design doc) → /ar (adversarial review) → /plan (execution plan) → /pmatch (validation) → /build (implementation) → /denoise (simplification) → /qf /qb (QA) → /qd (docs QA)

| Step | Expected Artifact | Found |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| /arm (brief) | Crystallized requirements brief | `PROCESS_DOCS/briefs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md` + 3 feature briefs |
| /design (design doc) | Design with architecture decisions | `PROCESS_DOCS/design/skillsets-cc-design.md` (16.3 KB) + 4 feature designs |
| /ar (adversarial review) | Multi-model critique report | `PROCESS_DOCS/reviews/skillsets-cc-ar-review.md` (8 KB) — names ar-o, ar-d reviewers with specific findings |
| /plan (execution plan) | Atomic task breakdown | `PROCESS_DOCS/execution/skillsets-cc-execution.md` (100+ KB) + 4 feature execution plans |
| /pmatch (validation) | Alignment report | Infrastructure verified (pm-s, pm-k agents); usage implied by execution plan structure |
| /build (implementation) | Code + tests | Reference repo is the built product (skillsets.cc registry) |
| /denoise (simplification) | Cleaned code | Infrastructure verified (skill + agent defined) |
| /qf /qb (QA audit) | Audit reports | Infrastructure verified (agents with detailed audit protocols) |
| /qd (docs QA) | Updated documentation | Infrastructure verified (qa-docs agent with iterative processing) |

**Multi-feature evidence**: 5+ features (MCP transparency, ghost entries, CLI auth, batch identity, XSS sanitization) follow the same workflow, proving reproducibility.

**Genuine work indicators**: Adversarial review contains specific findings (GitHub API rate limits, OAuth CSRF). Design doc includes decision rationale tables. Execution plans contain exact file paths and acceptance criteria. Cross-references between artifacts.

### Verdict

**APPROVED**

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Tier 1 passed | AUDIT_REPORT.md shows "READY FOR SUBMISSION" |
| 2 | Safety clear | No prompt injection, exfiltration, or manipulation found across 30 files |
| 3 | Coherent workflow | 11 skills + 9 agents + 6 resources + CLAUDE.md + Docker MCP form a complete multi-phase SDLC |
| 4 | Present primitives valid | All skills have descriptions and process; all agents have role/process/output; CLAUDE.md well-structured |
| 5 | Workflow proven | 4 briefs, 5 designs, 3 reviews, 5 execution plans found in reference repo — genuine multi-feature production use |

**Recommendations (non-blocking)**:
1. Add "Use when..." trigger phrases to denoise, qb, qd, qf skill descriptions for better auto-invocation
2. Pin MCP package versions in Docker config (e.g., `@upstash/context7-mcp@2.1.1`)
3. Populate CLAUDE.md "Lessons Learned" section as patterns emerge
