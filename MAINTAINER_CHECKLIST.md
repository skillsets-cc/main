# Maintainer Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing skillset submissions. This ensures consistent quality and thorough validation across all submissions.

## Pre-Review: Automated Checks

Before starting manual review, verify CI has passed:

- [ ] ✅ GitHub Actions workflow completed successfully
- [ ] ✅ JSON Schema validation passed
- [ ] ✅ Required files present (README.md, AUDIT_REPORT.md, content/)
- [ ] ✅ Content structure valid (.claude/ or CLAUDE.md exists)
- [ ] ✅ No files exceed 1MB
- [ ] ✅ No secrets detected
- [ ] ✅ Author verification passed

**If CI failed**: Request fixes before proceeding with manual review.

## Part 1: Production Proof Verification

This is the most critical part of the review. Production proof separates skillsets.cc from other registries.

### 1.1 Production URL Check

- [ ] Visit `verification.production_url` from `skillset.yaml`
- [ ] URL is accessible (not 404, not down)
- [ ] URL leads to one of:
  - [ ] A live deployed application/service
  - [ ] A public GitHub repository with recent activity (last 3 months)
  - [ ] A detailed case study or blog post
  - [ ] Documentation of production deployment

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ URL is unreachable or returns errors
- ❌ URL leads to personal homepage with no project details
- ❌ URL is a placeholder or "coming soon" page
- ❌ URL has no connection to the submitted skillset

### 1.2 Production Proof Quality

If `verification.production_proof` file (typically `PROOF.md`) is included:

- [ ] Review screenshots/videos for authenticity
  - [ ] Screenshots appear genuine (not stock images)
  - [ ] Screenshots show the skillset in use
  - [ ] Videos demonstrate actual workflow
- [ ] Check testimonials are from verifiable sources
  - [ ] Names and titles provided
  - [ ] Linked to real people (LinkedIn, GitHub)
  - [ ] Testimonials are specific, not generic
- [ ] Verify metrics are realistic and credible
  - [ ] Numbers make sense for the claimed usage
  - [ ] Metrics match repository evidence
  - [ ] Not exaggerated or fabricated

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Screenshots look staged or fake
- ❌ Testimonials are anonymous or vague
- ❌ Metrics seem inflated or unrealistic
- ❌ No actual evidence of production use

### 1.3 Repository Evidence (if GitHub URL)

If production_url points to a GitHub repository:

- [ ] Repository is public and accessible
- [ ] Recent commits (within last 3 months for "active" status)
- [ ] Clear evidence of Claude Code usage:
  - [ ] `.claude/` directory present
  - [ ] `CLAUDE.md` or similar instructions
  - [ ] `PROCESS_DOCS/` with design or execution files
- [ ] Not a fork without original contributions
- [ ] Has meaningful activity (not just initial commit)

**Repository Quality Indicators**:
- Stars: 10+ (good), 50+ (excellent)
- Forks: 5+ (good)
- Issues/PRs: Shows active development
- Documentation: Comprehensive README
- Tests: Test suite present and passing

### 1.4 Deployed Application Evidence (if live URL)

If production_url points to a deployed application:

- [ ] Application is live and functional
- [ ] Clear connection to the submitted skillset
  - [ ] Technology stack matches skillset description
  - [ ] Features align with claimed capabilities
- [ ] Shows signs of real usage:
  - [ ] User accounts/content (if applicable)
  - [ ] Analytics/metrics visible
  - [ ] Professional presentation

## Maintaining Quality Standards

The registry's value comes from its curation. It's okay to:
- ✅ Reject submissions that don't meet standards
- ✅ Request significant improvements
- ✅ Set a high bar for production proof
- ✅ Take time to review thoroughly

The goal is a registry of truly production-verified, high-quality skillsets—not maximum quantity.
