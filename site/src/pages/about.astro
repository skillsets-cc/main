        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-ink mb-4">The Problem</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Individual skills often conflict—namespace collisions, context window hogging, incompatible assumptions.
          Many work in isolation or simple demos but fail in complex production environments. The value isn't
          just in the tools themselves, but in the <em>orchestration strategies</em> and <em>context bridging</em> between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Atomic skill marketplaces give you ingredients. We give you the recipe—and proof that the dish has been served.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-ink mb-4">The Solution</h2>
        <p>
          A skillset is a reproducible configuration verified by real usage. Not a list of links—a complete
          workflow with skills, agents, prompts, MCP servers, and plugins that work together. Each one has
          shipped production software, with evidence to prove it.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-ink mb-4">Why Verification?</h2>
        <p>
          We use high friction to ensure high quality. Every skillset in the registry must provide
          production proof—a link to a live product, repository, or case study demonstrating real-world usage.
          This isn't a dump of untested configs; it's a curated collection of battle-tested workflows.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-ink mb-4">How It Works</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Browse or search the registry for workflows that match your needs</li>
          <li>Install with <code class="bg-stone-50 border border-border-ink px-2 py-0.5 font-mono text-sm">npx skillsets install @namespace/name</code></li>
          <li>Files are extracted directly to your project—no .git folders, no bloat</li>
          <li>Verify integrity with checksums against the registry</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This registry was architected and built by <a href="https://github.com/supercollectible" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@supercollectible</a> using
          <a href="/skillset/@supercollectible/Valence" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">Valence</a>—the first entry in the registry.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-text-ink mb-4">Open Source</h2>
        <p>
          The registry infrastructure is MIT-licensed. Individual skillsets are licensed by their authors.
          We believe production-proven workflows should be shared, studied, and improved upon.
