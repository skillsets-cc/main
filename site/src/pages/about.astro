        Behind every skillset is a power user who wired primitives into a repeatable workflow that ships production software. This is the bleeding edge of Claude Code orchestration and integration.

      <p>
        <strong class="text-text-ink">Skillsets.cc</strong> aims to be the definitive list.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every entry has shipped production software.
        <a href="/contribute" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">Submissions</a> require production proof, a structural audit, an Opus qualitative review, and human sign-off before merge.
        <a href="/" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">Browse</a> the registry or install via the <a href="/cli" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">CLI</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Submissions open in small batches. The team is small — <a href="https://github.com/supercollectible" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@supercollectible</a> and Claude, building with <a href="/skillset/@supercollectible/Valence" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">Valence</a>.
        We'd rather review thoroughly than scale recklessly.
