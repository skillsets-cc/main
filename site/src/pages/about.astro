        A skillset is a complete, battle-tested stack of Claude Code primitives that ship as one unit.
        The value is in the <em>orchestration</em> — how primitives are wired together, how context flows between them, and how the whole system behaves under real workloads.
        Skillsets.cc aims to be the definitive list.

      <p>
        Every entry has shipped production software.
        <a href="/contribute" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">Submissions</a> require production proof, a structural audit, an Opus qualitative review, and human sign-off before merge.
        Browse the registry or install via the <a href="/cli" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">CLI</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Submissions open in small batches because the review team is small — <a href="https://github.com/supercollectible" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@supercollectible</a> and Claude, building with <a href="/skillset/@supercollectible/Valence" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">Valence</a>.
        We'd rather review thoroughly than scale recklessly.
