        <strong class="text-text-ink">Skillsets.cc</strong> bets there are brilliant Claude Code power users out there who already wired the primitives into repeatable development workflows. This is the bleeding edge of orchestration and integration. We call these systems <strong class="text-text-ink">skillsets</strong> and aim to build the definitive list.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's no shortage of individual skills and CLAUDE.md fragments. The hard part is wiring them into a flow that holds up in production. A skillset is the integrated system, already debugged — install it and adapt it to your project. Claude can help with that part too.
        Submissions are reviewed on a best-effort basis with no security guarantees. You are the final quality gate, as with any OSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        You built a complete workflow, not a toy — but there's no credible channel for it. Your workflow gets a name, a listing, and distribution to every <code class="bg-white border border-border-ink px-2 py-1 rounded-none font-mono text-sm">npx skillsets</code> user.
        Submission is batched. The team is small — <a href="https://github.com/supercollectible" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@supercollectible</a> and Claude, building with <a href="/skillset/@supercollectible/Valence" class="text-orange-500 hover:underline">Valence</a>.
        We'd rather review thoroughly than scale recklessly.
